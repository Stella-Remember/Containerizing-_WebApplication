# Containerizing-_WebApplication
The main objective is to develop a minimal viable product (MVP)of the project management web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, you will containerize this application using Docker to ensure it can be easily deployed and scaled across different environments without any issues.

My startup plans to present this MVP at an upcoming tech conference to attract potential investors and early adopters. The ability to quickly deploy and scale the application in response to user feedback is crucial for its success. Using Docker demonstrates your team's technical proficiency and your commitment to modern, efficient development practices that are attractive to investors.
