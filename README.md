# Containerizing-_WebApplication
The main objective is to develop a minimal viable product (MVP)of the project management web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, you will containerize this application using Docker to ensure it can be easily deployed and scaled across different environment 


```bash 
git clone https://github.com/NiyonshutiDavid/hello.git
```
