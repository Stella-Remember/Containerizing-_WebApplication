# Containerizing-_WebApplication
The main objective is to develop a minimal viable product (MVP)of the project management web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, you will containerize this application using Docker to ensure it can be easily deployed and scaled across different environments without any issues.

##Web Application Development:

Develop a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should have the following basic features:
Ability to add new tasks.
View the list of tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
Feel free to use any additional libraries or frameworks suitable for the task. However, ensure the application remains lightweight and easy to deploy.

##Containerization with Docker:

Create a Dockerfile for your web application. This Dockerfile should include all necessary instructions to build a Docker image for your application, including:
Specifying the base image.
Installing any dependencies.
Copying your application code into the container.
Exposing the port on which the application runs.
Specifying the command to run the application.
Build the Docker image based on your Dockerfile.
Push the Docker image to Docker Hub, ensuring it's publicly accessible for evaluation.
